# Vivaldi Modding

## What

This repository is a collection of mods I have written for the [**Vivaldi web browser**](https://vivaldi.com). Each file is a standalone modification which works on its own, but you might as well bring them together: One `user.css` and one `user.js` file is generally all you need. Every mod contains a link to the Vivaldi forum topic it was first featured in, however the most up to date versions can be found on this github repo. I cannot guarantee that any of these mods function as advertised at this point in time, because occasionally adjustments have to be made when Vivaldi introduces updates, especially in case of a jump in the chromium version. But most of them should work out just fine. Nevertheless, if you should run into problems, feel free to open up an issue, or better post in the according Vivaldi forum topic.

## How to

Vivaldi's user interface is based on web technologies, therefore it's relatively easy to customize its appearance and functionality with CSS and Javascript. Detailed explanations on how to implement these modifications can be found in the [**Official Guide**](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi/40). The [**Modding Forum Board**](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) is a great resource, featuring guides on how to automate the process of patching your installation after updating the browser and providing you with a plethora of mods written by the community.
